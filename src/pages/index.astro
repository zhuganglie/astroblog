  <p>I know why you're here.</p>
    <p>I know what you've been doing.</p>
    <p>I know why you hardly sleep, and why night after night you sit at your computer.</p>
    <p>You're looking for him.</p>
    <p>I know, because I was once looking for the same thing.</p>
    <p>And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him, I was looking for an answer.</p>
    <p>It's the question that drives us.</p>
    <p>It's the question that brought you here.</p>
    <p>You know the question, just as I did.</p>
